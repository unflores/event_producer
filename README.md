# Producer

Produces events for some simulation you are planning on doing. This was actually shamelessly ripped off from some programming test that I did for chauffeur priv√©. I thought it was interesting and moved it into typescript.

Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) or node 8.12

## Docker

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up # starts images
docker-compose exec producer yarn # install dependencies
docker-compose exec producer yarn start # starts producing
```
